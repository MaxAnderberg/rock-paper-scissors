# Rock Paper Scissors 

For this [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) I made the famous rock paper scissors game. The assignment was divided into two parts. The first part was to build the basic functionality of the game, and the second part required a frontend to be set up with proper functionality connected so the user can play the game through the interface.

## Functionality 

The computer chooses randomly between rock, paper, and scissors. 

* First to 5 rounds win

* Ties counts as zero points for both the computer and the user

* When either the computer or the user reaches 5 rounds, the buttons will be disabled, and to play again, the user must click the ‘play again’ button
